## About
The **ERC Advanced Grant 885222-GreekSchools, The Greek Philosophical Schools according to Europe’s Earliest ‘History of Philosophy’: Towards a New Pioneering Critical Edition of Philodemus’ Arrangement of the Philosophers** (European Commission, Horizon 2020, ‘Ideas’, [https://greekschools.eu][gs], *PI: G. Ranocchia*) aims to provide a new critical edition, with introduction and commentary, of Philodemus of Gadara’s Arrangement of the Philosophers, a treatise in several books handed down by eight Herculaneum Papyri.

A crucial part of GreekSchools is engaging the scholarly community in a permanent collaborative review in progress of our critical edition by launching a new open-source scholarly Web platform on which the critical texts will be uploaded and be made available open-access, for papyrological and exegetical comments. The platform is composed by two different parts: a textual editing tool, and the open access viewer of the critical text. 

The repository includes, for each edited papyrus, both a diplomatic and a literary transcripition with palaeographic and critical apparatuses as well as a modern translation.

This material is permanently made accessible open access following the requirements foreseen for the project by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. 

## Goal
The goal is to create a flexible repertory of critical texts constantly monitored by the scholarly community by making both electronic texts and digital sources remotely accessible through a single interface with advanced search capabilities.
